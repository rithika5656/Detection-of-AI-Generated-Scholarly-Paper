The goal is to show a simple pipeline for text extraction, preprocessing, analysis, and reporting. Introduction Machine learning has seen rapid growth. The methodology follows standard experimental designs. Methods We collected data and ran standard analyses. The experimental setup is intentionally simple for demonstration purposes. Results The results show patterns in the data consistent with expectations. Further work is needed.",
